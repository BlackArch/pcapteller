WHAT IS PCAPTELLER?
====================

Pcapteller is a tool designed for traffic manipulation and replay.
The tool allows you to re-create a recorded network traffic scenario that occurred in a foreign network, as it really happened in yours.

Basically, the tool reads network packets from a pcap file, and replays them into your network.
The tool allows packet manipulation (MAC and IP addresses at this moment) prior to replay, so you can customize the traffic with specific 
addresses that fit your environment.

The tool is useful if you want to re-create scenarios where computer attacks or malware infections occurred.
Using such scenarios as a base, Pcapteller will make it look like everything is really happening in your own network.

Pcapteller can help you improving your blue team's network security monitoring skills, or creating network decoys during red team operations.
